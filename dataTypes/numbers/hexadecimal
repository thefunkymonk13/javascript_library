Hexadecimal
JavaScript interprets numeric constants as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x.

Example
let x = 0xFF;
Never write a number with a leading zero (like 07).
Some JavaScript versions interpret numbers as octal if they are written with a leading zero.

By default, JavaScript displays numbers as base 10 decimals.

But you can use the toString() method to output numbers from base 2 to base 36.

Hexadecimal is base 16. Decimal is base 10. Octal is base 8. Binary is base 2.

Example
let myNumber = 32;
myNumber.toString(32);
myNumber.toString(16);
myNumber.toString(12);
myNumber.toString(10);
myNumber.toString(8);
myNumber.toString(2);
