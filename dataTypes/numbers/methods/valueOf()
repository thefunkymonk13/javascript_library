The valueOf() Method
valueOf() returns a number as a number.

Example
let x = 123;
x.valueOf();
(123).valueOf();
(100 + 23).valueOf();
In JavaScript, a number can be a primitive value (typeof = number) or an object (typeof = object).

The valueOf() method is used internally in JavaScript to convert Number objects to primitive values.

There is no reason to use it in your code.

All JavaScript data types have a valueOf() and a toString() method.
