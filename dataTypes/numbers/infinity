Infinity
Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.

Example
let myNumber = 2;
// Execute until Infinity
while (myNumber != Infinity) {
  myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
}
Division by 0 (zero) also generates Infinity:

Example
let x =  2 / 0;
let y = -2 / 0;
Infinity is a number: typeof Infinity returns number.

Example
typeof Infinity;
