Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];      
It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.

Learn more about const with arrays in the chapter: JS Array Const.

Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

Example
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

Example
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";
Using the JavaScript Keyword new
The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:

Example
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
The two examples above do exactly the same.

There is no need to use new Array().

For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.
