JavaScript Array indexOf()
The indexOf() method searches an array for an element value and returns its position.

Note: The first item has position 0, the second item has position 1, and so on.

Example
Search an array for the item "Apple":

const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let position = fruits.indexOf("Apple") + 1;
Syntax
array.indexOf(item, start)
item	Required. The item to search for.
start	Optional. Where to start the search. Negative values will start at the given position counting from the end, and search to the end.
Array.indexOf() returns -1 if the item is not found.

If the item is present more than once, it returns the position of the first occurrence.
