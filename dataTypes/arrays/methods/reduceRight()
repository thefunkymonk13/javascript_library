JavaScript Array reduceRight()
The reduceRight() method runs a function on each array element to produce (reduce it to) a single value.

The reduceRight() works from right-to-left in the array. See also reduce().

The reduceRight() method does not reduce the original array.

This example finds the sum of all numbers in an array:

Example
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduceRight(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value, index, array) {
  return total + value;
}
Note that the function takes 4 arguments:

The total (the initial value / previously returned value)
The item value
The item index
The array itself
The example above does not use the index and array parameters. It can be rewritten to:

Example
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let sum = numbers.reduceRight(myFunction);

function myFunction(total, value) {
  return total + value;
}
