Sorting an Array
The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();

Numeric Sort
By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings.

This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").

However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".

Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.

You can fix this by providing a compare function:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
Use the same trick to sort an array descending:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return b - a});
