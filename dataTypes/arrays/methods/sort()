Sorting an Array
The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();

Numeric Sort
By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings.

This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").

However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".

Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.

You can fix this by providing a compare function:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
Use the same trick to sort an array descending:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return b - a});

Sorting an Array in Random Order
Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(){return 0.5 - Math.random()});

Find the Highest (or Lowest) Array Value
There are no built-in functions for finding the max or min value in an array.

However, after you have sorted an array, you can use the index to obtain the highest and lowest values.

Sorting ascending:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
// now points[0] contains the lowest value
// and points[points.length-1] contains the highest value
Sorting descending:

Example
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return b - a});
// now points[0] contains the highest value
// and points[points.length-1] contains the lowest value
Sorting a whole array is a very inefficient method if you only want to find the highest (or lowest) value.
