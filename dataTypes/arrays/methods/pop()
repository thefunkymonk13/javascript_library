Popping items out of an array

JavaScript Array pop()
The pop() method removes the last element from an array:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.pop();
The pop() method returns the value that was "popped out":

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.pop();
