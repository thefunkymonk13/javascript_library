JavaScript Array shift()
The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.shift();
The shift() method returns the value that was "shifted out":

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.shift();
