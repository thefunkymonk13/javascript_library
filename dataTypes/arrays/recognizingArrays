How to Recognize an Array
A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?

The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object":

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
let type = typeof fruits;
The typeof operator returns object because a JavaScript array is an object.

Solution 1:
To solve this problem ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 2009) defined a new method Array.isArray():

Array.isArray(fruits);
Solution 2:
The instanceof operator returns true if an object is created by a given constructor:

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];

fruits instanceof Array;
