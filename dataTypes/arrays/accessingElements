Accessing Array Elements
You access an array element by referring to the index number:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
Note: Array indexes start with 0.

[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

Accessing the First Array Element
Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[0];

Accessing the Last Array Element
Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];
