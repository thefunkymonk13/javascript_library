JavaScript String search()
The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match:

Example
let str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
str.search("locate");
Did You Notice?
The two methods, indexOf() and search(), are equal?

They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?

The two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).
You will learn more about regular expressions in a later chapter.
