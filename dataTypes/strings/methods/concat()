JavaScript String concat()
concat() joins two or more strings:

Example
let text1 = "Hello";
let text2 = "World";
let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2);
The concat() method can be used instead of the plus operator. These two lines do the same:

Example
text = "Hello" + " " + "World!";
text = "Hello".concat(" ", "World!");
Note
All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

Formally said:

Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
