Property Access
ECMAScript 5 (2009) allows property access [ ] on strings:

Example
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
let char = text[0];
Note
Property access might be a little unpredictable:

It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
If no character is found, [ ] returns undefined, while charAt() returns an empty string.
It is read only. str[0] = "A" gives no error (but does not work!)
Example
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
text[0] = "A";    // Gives no error, but does not work
