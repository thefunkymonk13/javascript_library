Replacing String Content
The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

Example
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
Note
The replace() method does not change the string it is called on.

The replace() method returns a new string.

The replace() method replaces only the first match

If you want to replace all matches, use a regular expression with the /g flag set. See examples below.

By default, the replace() method replaces only the first match:

Example
let text = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");

By default, the replace() method is case sensitive. Writing MICROSOFT (with upper-case) will not work:

Example
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("MICROSOFT", "W3Schools");

To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an /i flag (insensitive):

Example
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace(/MICROSOFT/i, "W3Schools");
