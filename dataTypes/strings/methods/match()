JavaScript String match()
The match() method searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns the matches, as an Array object.

Example 1
Search a string for "ain":

let text = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
text.match(/ain/g);

Note
If a regular expression does not include the g modifier (to perform a global search), the match() method will return only the first match in the string.

Syntax
string.match(regexp)
regexp	Required. The value to search for, as a regular expression.
Returns:	An Array, containing the matches, one item for each match, or null if no match is found
Example 2
Perform a global, case-insensitive search for "ain":

let text = "The rain in SPAIN stays mainly in the plain";
text.match(/ain/gi);
