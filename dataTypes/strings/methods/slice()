JavaScript String slice()
slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).

Example
Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13 (13 not included):

let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.slice(7, 13);

//Output Banana
