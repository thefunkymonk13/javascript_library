JavaScript String slice()
slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).

Example
Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13 (13 not included):

let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.slice(7, 13);

//Output Banana

JavaScript counts positions from zero.

First position is 0.

Second position is 1.

If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string.

This example slices out a portion of a string from position -12 to position -6:

Example
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.slice(-12, -6);
If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:

Example
let part = str.slice(7);
or, counting from the end:

Example
let part = str.slice(-12);
