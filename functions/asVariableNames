Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

Example
Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

let x = toCelsius(77);
let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
You can use the function directly, as a variable value:

let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
