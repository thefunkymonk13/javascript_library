Creating Date Objects
Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.

There are 4 ways to create a new date object:

new Date()
new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(date string)
new Date()
new Date() creates a new date object with the current date and time:

Example
const d = new Date();
Date objects are static. The computer time is ticking, but date objects are not.

new Date(year, month, ...)
new Date(year, month, ...) creates a new date object with a specified date and time.

7 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order):

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
Note: JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11:

January = 0.

December = 11.

Specifying a month higher than 11, will not result in an error but add the overflow to the next year:

Specifying:

const d = new Date(2018, 15, 24, 10, 33, 30);
Is the same as:

const d = new Date(2019, 3, 24, 10, 33, 30);
Specifying a day higher than max, will not result in an error but add the overflow to the next month:

Specifying:

const d = new Date(2018, 5, 35, 10, 33, 30);
Is the same as:

const d = new Date(2018, 6, 5, 10, 33, 30);
Using 6, 4, 3, or 2 Numbers
6 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second:

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30);
5 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, and minute:

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33);
4 numbers specify year, month, day, and hour:

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10);
3 numbers specify year, month, and day:

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11, 24);
2 numbers specify year and month:

Example
const d = new Date(2018, 11);
You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter it will be treated as milliseconds.

Example
const d = new Date(2018);
Previous Century
One and two digit years will be interpreted as 19xx:

Example
const d = new Date(99, 11, 24);
Example
const d = new Date(9, 11, 24);
new Date(dateString)
new Date(dateString) creates a new date object from a date string:

Example
const d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
