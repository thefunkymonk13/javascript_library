JavaScript Date Input
There are generally 3 types of JavaScript date input formats:

Type	Example
ISO Date	"2015-03-25" (The International Standard)
Short Date	"03/25/2015"
Long Date	"Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015"
The ISO format follows a strict standard in JavaScript.

The other formats are not so well defined and might be browser specific.
