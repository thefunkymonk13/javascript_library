JavaScript ISO Dates
ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times.

The ISO 8601 syntax (YYYY-MM-DD) is also the preferred JavaScript date format:

Example (Complete date)
const d = new Date("2015-03-25");

The computed date will be relative to your time zone.
Depending on your time zone, the result above will vary between March 24 and March 25.
