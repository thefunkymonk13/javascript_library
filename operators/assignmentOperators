JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y

Shift Assignment Operators
Operator	Example	Same As
<<=	x <<= y	x = x << y
>>=	x >>= y	x = x >> y
>>>=	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y

Logical Assignment Operators
Operator	Example	Same As
&=	x &= y	x = x & y
^=	x ^= y	x = x ^ y
|=	x |= y	x = x | y

The = Operator
The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

Simple Assignment
let x = 10;

The += Operator
The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable.

Addition Assignment
let x = 10;
x += 5;

The -= Operator
The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.

Subtraction Assignment
let x = 10;
x -= 5;

The *= Operator
The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable.

Multiplication Assignment
let x = 10;
x *= 5;

The /= Operator
The /= assignment divides a variable.

Division Assignment
let x = 10;
x /= 5;

The %= Operator
The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

Remainder Assignment
let x = 10;
x %= 5;

The <<= Operator
The <<= assignment operator left shifts a variable.

Left Shift Assignment
let x = -100;
x <<= 5;

The >>= Operator
The >>= assignment operator right shifts a variable (signed).

Right Shift Assignment
let x = -100;
x >>= 5;
The >>>= Operator
The >>>= assignment operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

Unsigned Right Shift Assignment
let x = -100;
x >>>= 5;
The &= Operator
The &= assignment operator ANDs a variable.

Bitwise AND Assignment
let x = 10;
x &= 5;
The != Operator
The != assignment operator ORs a variable.

Bitwise OR Assignment
let x = 10;
x != 5;
