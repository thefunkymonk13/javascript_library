It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

1.) Using var
When to Use JavaScript var?

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.



2.) Using let
If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

This will not work:

let carName = "Volvo";
let carName;


3.) Using const
When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

const carName = "Volvo";

4.) Using nothing
