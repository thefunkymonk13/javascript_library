The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

Cannot be Reassigned
A const variable cannot be reassigned:

Example
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

Must be Assigned
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

Correct
const PI = 3.14159265359;
Incorrect
const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;

When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp
