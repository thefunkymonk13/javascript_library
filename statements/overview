JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";
A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

let x = y + z;
JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
