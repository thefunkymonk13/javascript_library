JavaScript Identifiers / Names
Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Note
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
